Maze Runner: A maze generation and solving tool using the randomized Kruskals algorithm and the A* algorithm


 
 To generate a maze on the parameters given by the user.
 To implement Kruskal’s algorithm in order to generate the random maze.
 To find the shortest path from source to destination by implementing A* algorithm.
